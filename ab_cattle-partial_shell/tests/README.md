# test

Directory of unit tests.  Currently uses unittest but can be easily
adapted to use nose and/or py.test.

To run all unit tests defined in this directory, at the command line
type:

   python test.py

For some reason, I don't know why, using the Anaconda version of Python
doesn't work.  The model runs and you get printed results but you don't
get any of the visualization.
